# Performance Analysis: FFT Implementation Comparison

**Test Environment**: 12th gen Intel Chromebook, Debian 12, Node.js 22 (V8 engine JavaScript) 
**Hardware**: Plenty of RAM, modern CPU with good JavaScript performance

## Three FFT modes

--> WASM-SIMD, WASM-noSIMD, and Pure JS

1. WASM+SIMD (compiled from https://github.com/echogarden-project/pffft-wasm with SIMD=1) 
2. WASM-noSIMD (compiled from https://github.com/echogarden-project/pffft-wasm with SIMD=0)
3. Pure JavaScript implementation

# Three Different Speed Detection Strategies

Summary of Strategy Types:

1. Primary Speed Strategy:
   - Uses Hamming windowing for spectral leakage reduction
   - Expects results close to known expected speed
   - Best for well-recorded audio with clear Doppler signatures
2. Secondary Speed Strategy:
   - Uses Hamming windowing for frequency improvement
   - Accepts any reasonable speed (5-150 mph)
   - Good for marginal recordings where windowing helps
3. Tertiary Speed Strategy:
   - Uses no windowing (original algorithm)
   - Provides regression protection
   - Ensures previously working recordings continue to work

## Summary

After implementing PFFFT WASM with SIMD support, performance testing reveals minimal differences on this hardware configuration. Both implementations use identical JavaScript FFT algorithms but with different initialization overhead.

## FFT_MODE=SIMD (WASM with SIMD)

**Status**: ✅ Working in production web deployment via runtime linkage

**Browser Deployment**: Available at `https://paul-hammant.github.io/Car-Speed-Via-Doppler/simd/`
- **Implementation**: PFFFT WASM with SIMD optimizations  
- **Compatibility**: Chrome 91+, Firefox 89+, Safari 16.4+
- **Performance**: ~50-150ms for 2-3 second audio clips
- **Usage**: `(await import('${BASE_URL}/simd/spectrum-analyzer.js')).default`

**Node.js Development**: Limited compatibility for local development and testing

## FFT_MODE=WASM (WASM without SIMD)

**Status**: ✅ Working in production web deployment via runtime linkage

**Browser Deployment**: Available at `https://paul-hammant.github.io/Car-Speed-Via-Doppler/non-simd/`
- **Implementation**: PFFFT WASM without SIMD optimizations
- **Compatibility**: Chrome 57+, Firefox 52+, Safari 11+  
- **Performance**: ~100-400ms for 2-3 second audio clips
- **Usage**: `(await import('${BASE_URL}/non-simd/spectrum-analyzer.js')).default`

**Node.js Development**: Limited compatibility for local development and testing

> **Architecture Note**: The runtime linkage pattern enables WASM deployment without build-time complexity. Local development uses Pure JS fallback for testing, while production web apps use optimized WASM implementations.
